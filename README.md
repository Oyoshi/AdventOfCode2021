## TODO

- [ ] add crucial docstring with explanation
- [ ] run linter
- [ ] time complexity analysis
- [ ] time measure

## About Complexity and Readability

Complexities of most of my solutions are `O(n)` or `O(n*log(n))`. But sometimes I prefered to use brute force approach based on nested loops. There are three reasons to do it:

1. keep better readability and easier understandment
2. lack of time to spend 2 days figuring out sophisticated algorithm based on tricky algebra
3. premature optimization is the root of all evil (especially in terms of sizes of the input data)

## Requirements

* `Python 3.10.0+`
