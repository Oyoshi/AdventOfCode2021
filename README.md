## About Complexity and Readability

Complexities of most of my solutions are `O(n)` or `O(n*log(n))`. But sometimes I prefered to use brute force approach based on nested loops to keep better readability. They might be optimized by sophisticated algorithms and tricky algebra of course.

## Requirements

* `Python 3.10.0+`
