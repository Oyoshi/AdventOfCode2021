## About Complexity and Readability

Complexities of most of solutions are `O(n)`. But sometimes I prefered to use brute force approach based on nested loops. There are three reasons to do it:

1. keep better readability
2. sophisticated algorithms based on tricky algebra are hard to understand
3. premature optimization is the root of all evil (especially if we take into account sizes of the input data)

## Input Data

When it was easier I've provided input directly in a code instead of parsing `.txt` file. But for majority of cases I've read data from a file.

## Requirements

* `Python 3.10.0+`
